== A-POD
The Access POD or A-POD is a point of delivery of integrated software and hardware solutions that must contain the specifications compliant architectural components outlined below.

=== Border Network Gateway

The Border Network Gateway is expected to be compliant with meeting or exceeding the xref:attachment$TIP_OpenBNG_Requirements_1.0.pdf[OpenBNG Technical Requirements]. The Access POD must be able to have the required hardware capabilities in the form factor as well as leverage the ability to run virtual instances of the OpenBNG requirements a *vBNG* in the container fabric. This virtual BNG will not have the same capacitities as the hardware BNG but is required to have the same interfaces for SDN controllers and orchestrators.

The following software providers have shown to have compliant software or hardware meeting the specifications:
