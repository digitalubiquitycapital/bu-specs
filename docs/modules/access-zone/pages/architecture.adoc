= Architecture

== Overview

In order to meet the service requirements defined and required for the access zone as well as all of the non functional requirements on abstraction, security and vendor independance the following architecture is required and solutions MUST at minimum have the following components as part of the point of delivery (POD) solutions offered by the various vendors these internal components of the architecture are expected to be compliant to their respective set of specifications.

== Functional Requirements

The following image provides the functional elements that are *required* at a *minimum* for a compliants solution. Additional elements maybe added for completeness to the units of delivery.

== A-POD
The Access POD or A-POD is a point of delivery of integrated software and hardware solutions that must contain the specifications compliant architectural components outlined below.

=== Border Network Gateway

The Border Network Gateway is expected to be compliant with meeting or exceeding the xref:attachment$TIP_OpenBNG_Requirements_1.0.pdf[OpenBNG Technical Requirements]. The Access POD must be able to have the required hardware capabilities in the form factor as well as leverage the ability to run virtual instances of the OpenBNG requirements a *vBNG* in the container fabric. This virtual BNG will not have the same capacitities as the hardware BNG but is required to have the same interfaces for SDN controllers and orchestrators.

The following software providers have shown to have compliant software or hardware meeting the specifications:

|===
| Software | Hardware 

a|
* Benu Networks
* Altran / CapGemini
* Casa Systems
* RtBrick

a|
* APS Network
* Delta
* Edge-Core
* ufiSpace

This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list and provides only shortlisted compliant suppliers under the OpenBNG RFI activities by operators in December 2021.

=== Optical Line Terminal

The Optical Line terminal (OLT) and vendors solutions needs to be abstracted via an link:https://www.broadband-forum.org/open-broadband/open-broadband-software/open-broadband-broadband-access-abstraction-ob-baa[Open Broadband Access Abstraction] layer which provides vendor independences and compliance with the point of delivery specifications.

For each OLT it is required for the Point of Delivery (APOD or APOD Extender) to have a virtual OLT function representation or virtual OLT proxy which provides the proper level of provisioning abstractions and may represent aggregate fabric under a vOLT proxy representation of all the various OLTs from one or multiple vendors. 

Moreover, vOMCI functions for that specific OLT also needs proper representation in  a localized or extended container fabric. This allows for consistant and cohenrant management of the OMCI capabilities without vendor lock-in.

The following vendors been involved in interoperability with the abstraction layer: 

* Altice Labs
* Altran / CapGemini
* Calix
* FiberHome
* Iskratel
* Tibit Communications Inc.
* ZTE
* Huawei
* Nokia

=== Compute Fabric

The Computre Fabric is a small compute node that can run at least the vOLT, vOCMI and vBNG functional services. These also should be leverageable by end users of emerging services to provide enhanced services such as caching, virtual firewalls, IoT gateway software, etc.  

The compute fabric should be able to address a broad variety of use cases including 5G, AI, Edge Iaas/PaaS, IoT for both providers and enterprise edge domains. The fabric should be able to run multiple workloads such as VMs, Containers, micro services, etc.

It should leverage the link:lfedge.org[LF Edge] initiative software solutions based and supported as part of the solution for the point of delivery and integrated in the operational flow of the fabric.
