= Zone Services

== Service Definitions

Access Zones have multiple types of services that must be offered and controlled under the proper systems. Bitream Access Services, Routing, Provider Edge and Subcriber Management features have to work properly to offer a multi-service broadband access utility that can be comply with xref:attachment$TR-178.pdf[Broadband Forum Technical Report TR-178] on multi-service broadband access while also providing the proper capabilities for hardware isolation and ehanced multi-tenancy for security.

=== Bitstream Access Services 

Layer 2 Bistream Access Services (L2BAS) are to be provided via either XGS-PON, 25GS-PON or WDM-PON as part of the solution based on the Access Zone.

The  must be able to forward bitstream services at least based on the following encapsulations: 

* no tagging, 
* VLAN tagging (IEEE 802.1Q), 
* VLAN Provider Bridging tagging (IEEE 802.1ad) 
* MACinMAC Provider Backbone Bridging (IEEE 802.1ah). 

Whereas double tagging is employed, The TPID value of 0x8100 as the outer VLAN tag shall also be possible, together with the standard 0x88A8 as the outer VLAN tag.

=== Enterprise Services

In the provision of L2 services for enterprise customers, the L2BAS shall be MEF 3.0 compliant, at least with regards to E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE services. It will be very beneficial that the proposed platform be certified accordingly.

In particular, the platform must support the implementation of E-LINE services based on VLL technology, and E-LAN services based on VPLS or H-VPLS. 

* The solution proposed platform will permit the establishment of CIR, EIR, CBS and EBS parameters over the L2VPN service and/or each specific L2VPN client connection.

* The proposed platform will permit configuring specific Layer-2 based filters per each L2VPN client connection. Other standard security measures shall be supported as well.

* For E-LAN and E-TREE services, it must bepossible to configure in the proposed platform a different rate limit per each type of Broadcast, Unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic (one for broadcast, one for unknown unicast and one for multicast). It must also be possible to configure limits in the number of learnt MAC addresses per service and client interface, and the lifetime for these
learnt MAC addresses.

Finally, redundancy mechanisms, loop detection mechanisms and OAM
functionalities shall be required for Direct Fiber Access Services. IGMP snooping must also be supported.


===Â Far Edge Computing Services

Far Edge computing workloads must be able to run new experiences (i.e industrial IoT, 3D/XR content, real-time collaboration) demand more responsive connectivity and symmetric capacities. Compute shifting closer to the user; thereby redefining end-to-end (E2E) network performance requirements (i.e low, single-digit and sub-1ms latency are becoming a requirement). The workloads managers must be able to run virtualized appliances and cloud native workloads.

=== Lawful Intercept
The Lawful Interception mechanism supported by the Access Zone must be
compliant with ETSI specifications like link:https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101900_101999/101943/02.02.01_60/tr_101943v020201p.pdf[ETSI TR 101 943 (2006)] and in particular with regards to Reference Points INI1, INI2 and INI3 (X1, X2 and X3 in 3GPPP standards). The hardware and software platform must implement the Internal Intercept Function (IIF), while access and control of this function will only be possible from an Administration Function (ADMF). This access will be done ensuring that:

. There is a single dedicated user profile, duly authenticated, with features not
accessible to any other user profile (not even administrator). LI related
configurations will only be visible for this profile.
. Connectivity is limited to a single IP and port, with only one concurrent user,
which is the ADMF.

== Service Level Requirements
The Bitstream services are best effort services and it is expected that the direct fiber access services work in conjunction with the Community Zone service level requirements and definitions offered as outlined under the particular product SLA. These SLAs are project and product specifics and need to be established as part of the project management requirements for the local market needs and realities by the governance of the project or the broadband utility commercial plans.
