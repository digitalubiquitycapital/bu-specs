= Architecture
== Overview

The community zone is required to meet all requirements expressed in terms of abstraction, security and provider interoperability. Its architecture MUST at minimum have the following components as part of Community Zone Point Of Delivery (POD): 

. Aggregation Switching/Routing, 
. Label Routing, 
. Compute Fabric, 

Whereas different vendors provide different components of the Community Zone, they are expected to be compliant to their respective subset of specifications such that the Community Zone is compliant overall to all required specifications.

== Functional Requirements

The following image provides the functional elements that are *required* at a *minimum* for a compliants solution. Additional elements maybe added for completeness to the units of delivery.

== C-POD
The Community Zone POD or C-POD is a point of delivery of integrated software and hardware solutions that must contain the specifications compliant architectural components outlined below.

=== Aggregation Switch/Router
The Aggregation Switch must be capable of providing MPLS-PE provider edge functions as expected in order to provider the proper Carrier Ethernet transport services. It must also be able to interact with the market zone higher level services (Retail ISP, Emerging Services) by offering IP services when occasionally required through the interfaces and APIs.

=== Label Router
The label router must be able to manage segment 


=== Compute Fabric

== Interconnections

=== Protected Paths
